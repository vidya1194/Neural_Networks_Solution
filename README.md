# Neural Networks Solution

## Overview

This project contains the implementation of various machine learning models, including regression models, using Python. The code is modularized to enhance readability and maintainability, with separate modules for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and logging.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: Entry point for the project. This script coordinates the overall workflow of loading data, processing features, training models, and generating predictions.
- **src/**: Contains the source code, organized into the following modules:
  - **data/**: 
    - **data_loading.py**: Functions for loading and preprocessing the data.
  - **features/**: 
    - **build_features.py**: Functions for creating and engineering features.
  - **models/**: 
    - **train_model.py**: Functions for training machine learning models.
    - **evaluate_model.py**: Functions for evaluating the performance of the models.
  - **partition/**: 
    - **data_partition.py**: Functions for splitting the data into training and testing sets.
  - **utils/**: 
    - **utils.py**: Utility functions such as logging and error handling.
- **data/**: Directory to store datasets.
- **logs/**: Contains the logs generated during the execution of the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python packages required to run the project.
- **README.md**: This file, containing an overview and instructions.
